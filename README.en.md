# ZhuaTech Identity and Access Management

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise security, identity, compliance, and risk governance.

ZhuaTech Identity and Access Management provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise security, identity, compliance, and risk governance. It is designed for security, risk, compliance, audit, and platform operations teams, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise identity and access management, self-hosted identity and access management, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Solution Overview

- **Primary users:** Security, risk, compliance, audit, and platform operations teams.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Business Coverage

- **Asset and control inventory** — Manage asset and control inventory with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Policy and access governance** — Coordinate policy and access governance through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Detection and assessment workflows** — Track detection and assessment workflows metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Risk-based approval gates** — Preserve risk-based approval gates evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Remediation tracking and evidence** — Expose remediation tracking and evidence in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Security metrics and audit reporting** — Connect security metrics and audit reporting to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Implementation Stack

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Local Deployment

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
